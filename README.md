# rfid-db-tool

![Screenshot](/img/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This little Python/Tk GUI tool was created for locally storing and managing RFID numbers list and uploading it to a doorlock embedded device using a binary protocol through a serial UART interface.

The embedded device was created by a master's student, whom I helped with developing the PC part of their project.

This project might be useful for people developing a similar application, or for people who are learning Python GUI development using Tk, or learning binary protocols using a serial communication interface.

Use `python3 rfid-db-tool.py` to run the application
